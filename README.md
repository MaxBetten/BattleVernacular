# BattleVernacular
This is the code for a trivia game similar to Trivia Crack, but with language translations and learning. It's still in it's infancy stage with a lot of testing and development. 


There are multiple classes for the different activities occurring and the different methods they carry. The XML files were mostly developed in Android Studio IDE but also adjusted in it's actual code when necessary. In it's current state the code has a simple library of words to translate from English to German and can keep track if you get 3 correct and win the game.
